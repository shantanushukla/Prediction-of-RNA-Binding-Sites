# Prediction-of-RNA-Binding-Sites
Proteins are the molecular workforces in living organisms. They perform a broad range of essential functions. They catalyze metabolic reactions, replicate DNA, respond to stimuli, provide movement, and much more.   So in this challenge, we will try to look upon a specific type of protein named RBPs                 (RNA Binding Proteins) with a specific function i.e to bind to a specific target site on RNA. RBPs bind to specific target sites, how they identify these sites is still under research. Understanding how these proteins bind to a specific RNA is of great importance as it can provide us with another way to identify target proteins with similar functions. So the identification of RBPs and their binding sites is a major challenge in the field of molecular recognition. Determining the RNA interacting residues in a protein from its structure is quite easy but it is time-consuming and costly.     So we want to develop a machine learning model to predict RNA binding sites of a protein from its amino acid sequence.
